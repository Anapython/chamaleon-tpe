# chamaleon-tpe
I want to create a program linked to the mimetism of chamaleons wich could be artistically used in everyday life.
Hey everyone, so i am now in my last year of highschool and i like programming on my free time. I love visual arts, (animation, movies, photography, ...) and I am really interested in doing something about mimetism in programing, but i don't have precise ideas... 
Maybe something about wallpapers?
